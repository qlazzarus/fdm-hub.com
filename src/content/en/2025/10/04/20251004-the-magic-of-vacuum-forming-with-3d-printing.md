**Welcome to the FDM Hub Weekly Digest!** üåü If you thought 3D printing was only about extruding plastic, buckle up, because this week we've got a delightful mix of innovation, persistence, and some jaw-dropping designs that will leave you inspired! 

Let‚Äôs dive into the treasures from our 3D printing community!

First up, we have a mind-blowing combination of vacuum forming and 3D printing shared by one of our talented members. They‚Äôre not just blowing smoke; they‚Äôre enveloping designs in vacuum-sealed brilliance! By using 3D printed molds, they've dialed up their vacuum forming game to a whole new level, crafting custom shapes that leave cookie-cutter designs quaking in their boots. With personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout, this insightful post is just the ticket for anyone itching to blend these two ingenious techniques. Consider this a call to arms‚Äîor should I say arms and molds?‚Äîfor makers everywhere! Check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1ny2biu/vacuum_forming_3d_printing_is_so_cool/) and see what kinds of creative ruckus you can get into.

Next, let‚Äôs journey into the world of persistence with a fantastic tale of triumph! After seven grueling months of designing, prototyping, and more trial and error than a mad scientist in a lab, a dedicated maker finally saw their project skyrocket into success. This post is pure gold for anyone who‚Äôs feeling deterred by their own 3D printing challenges ‚Äî luck be nimble, luck be quick, it may take a tick!
