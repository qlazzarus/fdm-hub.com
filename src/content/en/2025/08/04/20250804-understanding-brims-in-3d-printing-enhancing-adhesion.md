## Understanding Brims in 3D Printing: Enhancing Adhesion
![image](https://cdn.creality.com/blogs/53f0153c6b2f7ec4d7ff73796382aaf6.png)

A brim is an essential feature in 3D printing that enhances the adhesion of prints to the build platform. By adding a few extra layers around the base of the model, it helps prevent warping and improves overall stability during the printing process. This technique is particularly beneficial for prints with smaller footprints or those made from materials prone to warping. Utilizing a brim can lead to higher success rates and better print quality.
