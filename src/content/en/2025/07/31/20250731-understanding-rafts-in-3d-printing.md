Rafts are a foundational layer used in 3D printing to enhance adhesion between the print and the build platform. They create a stable base that can help prevent warping and improve the overall quality of the finished model. While rafts can consume additional material and time, they are particularly useful for printing with challenging materials or complex geometries. Knowing when and how to use rafts can significantly improve your 3D printing outcomes.
